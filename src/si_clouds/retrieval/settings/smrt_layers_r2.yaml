# Sea ice and snow layer definitions for SMRT simulations.
# The individual sea ice and snow layer definitions allow for sensitivity tests
# and simulations with few fixed and few varying parameters. Also, layer 
# arrangement is flexible, e.g., number of snow layers, sea ice types, etc.
# Profiles (snowpack or sea ice) are combined to mediums.
# Gaussian distributions assumed for all uncertainty ranges: [mean, std]
# Temperatures are defined only at interfaces and not for each layer as 
# expected by SMRT.
